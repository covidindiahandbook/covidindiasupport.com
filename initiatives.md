## [COVID Resource Tracker](https://covidindiasupport.com/tracker) 

&lt;temporarily down&gt;

We have built a simple [resource tracker](http://covidindiasupport.com/tracker) for crisis management. This is meant to help match requests by individuals/organisations with volunteers/supplies and to track request status. You can request/ report availability of Remdesivir, oxygen tanks, hospital beds, PPE Kits, tiffin services etc. through filling out a simple form on the tracker: [https://airtable.com/shrvRntrU5mvEV0LW](https://airtable.com/shrvRntrU5mvEV0LW) . We are in the process of building out a new improved version. 

## [Help A Stranger](https://donate.covidindiasupport.com)

A platform for enabling micro-donations to financially affected demographics like daily wage labourers.
