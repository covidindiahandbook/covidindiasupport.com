**There are no coding skills necessary to contribute content!    
This is a community driven project. You can make improvements too!**

[**How to make improvements to our content?**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rySoaC8TFqwsCQH4LHS0p7lVHnmXvFmiSN_1b8cpYk8/edit)

* **Find “India specific”- REGIONAL resources about the novel Coronavirus, add the link/data in one of the relevant subsections/sub documents.** 
* **There are already many good sources doing infection tracking in India - please link them as you find them. However, this page is not intended to be another infection tracking mechanism - we want to instead organize local knowledge and efforts to help people easily discover India-specific COVID-19 related information and resources. Time is of the essence and crowdsourcing is the way to scale our development efforts.** 
* **This page and project is evolving, don’t hesitate to address any shortcomings you see! We suggest discussing ideas on the slack channel before making major changes.** 
* **Note: Please list your source when editing the linked documents. If the source is not verifiable, the entry will be eventually removed.**
